# Deploying VaultDrop to Vercel

VaultDrop is a standard Next.js app. It needs a Postgres database (Supabase) and
a handful of environment variables. There is **no separate migration or key
setup step** — the database schema and the enclave identity both initialize
themselves on first request.

## 1. Prerequisites

- A **Supabase** project (for Postgres). Copy its **connection pooler** URL.
- A **GitHub** repo with this code.
- A **Vercel** account.

## 2. Environment variables

Set these in Vercel → Project → Settings → Environment Variables. They mirror
`.env.example`.

| Variable | Required | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | Supabase **pooler** connection string. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Yes | Supabase project URL. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Yes | Supabase publishable key. The legacy anon key also works via `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | Yes | Your deployment URL, e.g. `https://vaultdrop.vercel.app`. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FLARE_NETWORK` | Yes | `coston2` |
| `ENCLAVE_MODE` | Yes | `simulated` |
| `FCE_PROXY_URL` | — | Only for `ENCLAVE_MODE=coston2`. |
| `FLARE_RPC_URL` | — | Optional Coston2 RPC override. |

> Use the Supabase **connection pooler** URL (not the direct connection). The DB
> client sets `prepare: false`, which is required behind the pooler.

## 3. Configure Google authentication

1. In Supabase, open **Authentication -> Providers -> Google** and enable it.
2. Create Google OAuth credentials and paste the client ID and secret into the
   Supabase Google provider settings. Use the Supabase callback URL shown there
   as the authorized redirect URI in Google Cloud.
3. In Supabase **Authentication -> URL Configuration**, set the site URL and
   allow both callback URLs:
   - `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`
   - `https://your-domain.example/auth/callback`
4. Copy the project URL and publishable key from Supabase into the environment
   variables above.

The same **Continue with Google** action handles both first-time signup and
returning-user login.

## 4. Deploy

1. Push the repo to GitHub.
2. In Vercel, **Import** the repo. The framework is auto-detected as Next.js;
   the default build command (`next build`) and output settings are correct.
3. Add the environment variables above.
4. **Deploy.**

On the first request, the app creates its tables (`vaults`, `vault_blobs`,
`enclave_identity`, `vault_seals`) and generates the enclave keypair, persisting
it in `enclave_identity`. Nothing else to configure.

## 5. Things to know

- **Runtime.** All API routes run on the Node.js runtime (they use Web Crypto +
  the `postgres` driver). Do not switch them to the Edge runtime.
- **Upload size.** Ciphertext is uploaded through a serverless function, which
  caps request bodies at ~4.5 MB, so `MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` is **4 MB**. To support
  larger files, add a signed direct-to-Supabase-Storage upload path that bypasses
  the function (the encryption model is unchanged — it's still ciphertext only).
- **The enclave.** In `simulated` mode the enclave runs in-process — real ECIES
  key custody + ECDSA attestation on ordinary hardware. This is honest to state
  as "confidential-compute-style key custody, simulated." Switching to real
  Flare Confidential Compute is `ENCLAVE_MODE=coston2` + `FCE_PROXY_URL`
  (requires the FCE extension running and a Flare indexer credential). No code
  changes — the `EnclaveEngine` interface is the only thing that switches.
- **On-chain conditions.** wallet / token / NFT checks read Coston2 via
  `FLARE_RPC_URL` (defaults to the public endpoint). Read-only; no funds needed.
- **Secrets.** The content key is never stored server-side and never in the share
  link — it is sealed to the enclave. `.env.local` is git-ignored; only
  `.env.example` is committed.
